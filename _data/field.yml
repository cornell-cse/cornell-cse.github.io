    Modeling of heat and mass transfer, fluid flow and some solid
    mechanics in biological and biomedical processes. We make
    physics-based numerical models of food processes to be able to
    optimize product, process and equipment for improved quality and
    safety.  Also, these models can be used to build automated
    appliances/ machinery that provide custom quality.  In biomedical
    applications, the goal of modeling is to obtain better insight
    into procedures and be able to optimize them.
