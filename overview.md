Within the sciences and engineering, it is frequently the interplay
between theory, experiment, and computation that prompts
innovation. To be effective in this environment, one needs a
background that is rich in both applications and supporting areas of
computer science and mathematics. The CSE Minor is tailor-made for
this purpose. Created under the auspices of CIS, the program enables
computationally-oriented students to amplify their research strengths
by choosing a modest number of suitable courses from a menu. We
subscribe to the philosophy articulated by the [SIAM Working Group on
CSE Education][cse-wg]:

> Going from application area to computational results requires domain
> expertise, mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, algorithm
> development, software implementation, program execution, analysis,
> validation and visualization of results. CSE involves all of
> this. Although it includes elements from computer science, applied
> mathematics, engineering and science, CSE focuses on the integration
> of knowledge and methodologies from all of these disciplines, and as
> such is a subject which is distinct from any of them.  Cornell is
> well-known for its support of multidisciplinary education and the
> CSE minor exemplifies this university strength.
