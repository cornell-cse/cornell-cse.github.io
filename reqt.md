subtitle: Requirements for the CSE Minor
nav: reqt

### The CSE Committee Member

The student must have a special committee member who belongs to the
Graduate Minor Field of Computational Science and Engineering ([see
list](people.html)). It is the responsibility of the CSE member to ensure that the
requirements are satisfied and expectations met. A measure of
flexibility is to be expected given the breadth of tradition across
CSE-related fields.

### Courses

The student must complete three CSE courses at the 400-level or above
and is expected to receive a letter grade of B+ or better in each.

1. Approval: The three courses must be approved by the CSE committee
   member.  In general, CSE courses are characterized by development
   of algorithms or visualization, use of computers, and applications
   to scientific or engineering problems. See the list of currently
   approved CSE courses. Whether or not these courses can also be used
   to satisfy requirements for the major field is a matter for the
   student's Special Committee.

2. Level: At least two of the courses should be at the 600-level or
   above.

3. Breadth: At least two of the courses should be outside the
   student’s home department.  In the case of a student whose major
   field is not associated with a Cornell department (such as Applied
   Mathematics), no more than two of the courses can come from the
   same department.

4. Core: At least one of the courses must be a core algorithms course.
   “Core algorithms” courses focus on the development and analysis of
   algorithms and are applicable to many disciplines in science and
   engineering.

### Project

The student must complete a substantial CSE software project.  It is
envisioned that most students seeking the minor will propose the
software project during their A-exam and complete the project as part
of their PhD thesis research. Alternatively, the project requirement
may be completed using a project from a course or from an external
summer internship.  Algorithmic novelty is a not a requirement of the
project, i.e., it is acceptable for a project to involve the
application of a known algorithm to a new problem.

The student will prepare a brief report for the Special Committee on
the project that will describe the software project and will include

- the problem that it solves, including expected form of the inputs
  and form of the outputs,
- the choice of algorithm,
- accuracy of approximations made by the algorithm,
- efficiency considerations,
- other implementation considerations such as choice of programming
  language, etc.,
- tradeoffs encountered during project design.

As agreed upon by the Special Committee, the report may be (a) a
free-standing written document, (b) part of the student’s
dissertation, or (c) an oral presentation, that is part of the A- or
B-exam.
