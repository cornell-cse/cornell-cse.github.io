The CSE student email list is <cse-student-l@cornell.edu>.
To join, send mail to <cse-student-l-request@cornell.edu> with
the subject `join`; to leave, send email to the same address with
the subject `leave`.

The purpose of this list is to attract students (postdocs and research
staff) across campus that have an interest in CSE. The email list is
not limited to graduate students that are officially affiliated
with the minor. We would like the list to serve as a vehicle for
communication to and among the students, in terms of seminars, courses
and other activities.
