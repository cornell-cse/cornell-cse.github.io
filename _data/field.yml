    Stability analysis when a small disturbance triggers a dramatic

    thermal runaway of a reactor (chemistry), the reversal of the
    earth's magnetic field (geophysics), and the onset of global
    climate change (climatology). Instability results from an
    imbalance that carries the system away from the sometimes delicate
    balance represented by equilibrium.

    Large-scale resource allocation problems under
    uncertainty. Techniques involve dynamic programming, stochastic
    optimization, machine learning and stochastic approximation to tackle
    problems whose conventional dynamic programming formulations involve
    high-dimensional vector-valued state variables. Research exploits
    structural properties of the underlying problem (such as monotonicity,
    convexity, submodularitry) to enhance performance. Applications in the
    areas of dynamic fleet management and inventory control. Other
    research interests include pricing problems that arise in conjunction
    with the allocation of resources over complex physical networks under
    uncertainty. Such problems arise in freight, data transmission
    capacity and airfare pricing.
