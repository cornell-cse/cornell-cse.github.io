  The CIS program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) spans
  several dozen departments and research areas. The field is
  application-driven and involves a mix of applied mathematics,
  numerical analysis, and computer science.

  A priority of the CSE program is the development of a coordinated
  curriculum that serves computationally-oriented graduate students
  throughout science and engineering.
